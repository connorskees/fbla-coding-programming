# How to Run

To build from source, unzip or untar `source.zip` or `source.tar.gz` respectively and follow the instructions in `INSTALL.md` inside.

To run the precompiled binaries on Windows, download either `win-x64` or `win-x86` based on your architecture from the FBLA Dropbox. Unzip the archive after downloading it. Inside, you should see the directory structure

```
C:.
